# arduino-segway
Miniature Arduino powered "Segway". Base code sketch "ArdunioSegway" balances the robot with an additional option of remote control. Combination of open-source code + added specifics. PID calculated via MATLAB or can be done just by trial and error.  
Additional program for Ardunio nano remote added.

Rough sketch. Hopefully comments help some.
